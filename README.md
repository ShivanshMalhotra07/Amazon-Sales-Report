In this project, I use Python and Jupyter Notebook to perform data analysis on the sales data of Amazon, one of the largest online retailers in the world. I aim to discover the patterns and trends of the customersâ€™ preferences and choices when they purchase different types of couriers from Amazon. I also want to understand the factors that influence their decisions and how they vary across different regions and seasons. This is my first project that I have uploaded to GitHub, a platform that allows me to share my code and results with other developers and researchers. I hope that this project will demonstrate my skills and knowledge in data analysis and Python programming, as well as provide some useful insights into the online shopping behavior of Amazon customers
